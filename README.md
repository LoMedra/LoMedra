- 👋 Hi, I’m @LoMedra
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Design & development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Go
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UI and UX companies, because I would like to develop more in this field since I graduated in design engineering that focuses a lot on user analysis
- 📫 How to reach me in discord: Lo Medra
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy read fantasy books and Journals about Design. And I have to admit, I fell in love with Tokyo Revengers
